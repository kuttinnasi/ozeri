                    <p>Fr. Peter Rookey traveled to the Holy Land in 2010, and this documentary of his pilgrimage there was produced in his honor by Chuck Neff of Relevant Radio and by Our Sorrowful Mother's Ministry in Vandalia, Illinois. Recording artist, Annie Karto sings the theme song in this film. I hope you will be very blessed by viewing it. Father is now with the Lord and Our Lady. We pray for his intercession before God's throne for our intentions. He was truly a gift from above for all of us who knew him. We love you, Fr. Peter!!!</p>
