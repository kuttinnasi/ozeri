Peter Rookey is seen with many of his closest friends and family members in this wonderful DVD produced shortly after his death by his best friend, Bob Benson from Milwaukee, who assisted him greatly for many years. This video will make you smile and will make you cry as you fondly remember this holy man of God who brought so much joy into our lives. May he enjoy his heavenly reward and intercede before God's throne for us who knew and loved him.</p>
