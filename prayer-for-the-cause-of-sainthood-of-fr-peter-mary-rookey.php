                        Heavenly Father, we believe that from the depths of your merciful love you have bestowed upon the world a great gift in giving us Father Peter Mary Rookey. He was our dear friend in persona Christi and helped to lead countless souls to you. He brought Jesus Christ your son to us by making Him truly present, body, blood, soul and divinity upon the altar in every Mass he offered. He showed us that we are each especially loved as a child of God. His healing touch left an indelible mark on us when he laid his hands upon us to heal our wounds of body, mind and spirit. May this humble, holy priest who never thought of himself but continuously poured himself out for others, for the glory of God, through the intercession of our Lady of Sorrows, be proclaimed in time, a saint and be raised to the altar by the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.
                    </p>
