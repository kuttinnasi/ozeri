                        <p>Fr. Peter Rookey sings the Stabat Mater in honor of Mary, the Sorrowful Mother of the crucified Jesus. This recording was produced by Mary's Helper's Inc. of Marrero, Louisiana in 1989. In this video, we see the silver chalice that Fr. Peter used at his office Masses the last 8 years of his life, including at the very last Mass he celebrated the day before his death. Also pictured are a stole he wore for Mass, the Roman collar he wore during his last day on earth, and his winter cap. On the far right, we see the crucifix that resided on Father's coffin during his wake and funeral at Our Lady of Sorrows Basilica in Chicago from Sept. 13th through Sept. 15th, 2014. This video was made by Father's nephew and niece, Tim and Anne Rookey of Middleton, Wisconsin. Fr. Peter celebrated at least 20 Masses in this very location shown in the video from 2000 to 2011.</p>
